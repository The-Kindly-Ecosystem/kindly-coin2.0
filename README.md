### Project Overview

Kindlyâ€™s bridging the gap between social impact and Web3 with the creation of innovative consumer and business-related products that generate, track and execute certified measurable social impact on the blockchain.

### Purpose & Functionalities of the Kindly Coin

Kindly Coin is a humanitarian-based cryptocurrency which will be used to purchase social impact, pay transaction fees, stake, and transport value across multiple blockchains. It will serve several unique purposes within our ecosystem linked to a variety of upcoming socially responsible products and services. Once our ecosystem becomes fully operational we will then look to decentralize various aspects of the project and utilize Kindly Coin to implement voting and governance mechanisms.
